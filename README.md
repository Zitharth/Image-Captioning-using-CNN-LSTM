# Image-Captioning-using-CNN-LSTM
The Convolution Neural Network (CNN) (Densenet201 Architecture)  is implemented for detecting features from the printed image and its associated caption. The Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network is used as a captioning tool to describe the detected text from images .
